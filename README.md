    - [x] 1. Replace each VStack in our form with a Section, where the text view is the title of the section. Do you prefer this layout or the VStack layout? It’s your app – you choose!
        - My POV: Between VStack and Section, it is a toss up. If we are talking aobut NOT modifiying anything about the views, VStack makes it easy. However, modifying a Section and using it is a great option as well.
